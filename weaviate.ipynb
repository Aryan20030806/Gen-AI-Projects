A sin- gle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi- ple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec- tion performance. This uniﬁed model has several beneﬁts over traditional methods of object detection.\\n\\nFirst, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection as a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline. We simply run our neural network on a new image at test time to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45 frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan X GPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This means we can process streaming video in real-time with less than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO achieves more than twice the mean average precision of other real-time systems.
